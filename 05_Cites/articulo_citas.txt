As COVID-19 spread in the United States, this study therefore aimed to examine age differences in risk perceptions, anxiety, and depression.In March 2020, a nationally representative address-based sample of 6,666 U.S. adults assessed their perceived risk of getting COVID-19, dying if getting it, getting quarantined, losing their job (if currently working), and running out of money. They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression. Demographic variables and precrisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported.In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety. Findings held after additionally controlling for precrisis reports of depression diagnosis.With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, U.S. adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis. Implications for risk communication and mental health interventions are discussed.}",

The detailed knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 structure and clinical aspects offers an important insight into the evolution of infection, disease progression and helps in executing the different therapies effectively. Herein, we have discussed in detail about the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 and its role in the proteomic rational spread of different muted species and pathogenesis in infecting the host cells. The mechanisms behind the viral outbreak and its immune response, the availability of existing diagnostics techniques, the treatment efficacy of repurposed drugs and the emerging vaccine trials for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak also have been highlighted. Furthermore, the possible antiviral effects of various herbal products and their extracted molecules in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and cellular entry are also reported. Finally, we conclude our opinion on current challenges involved in the drug development, bulk production of drug/vaccines and their storage requirements, logistical procedures and limitations related to dosage trials for larger population.}

abstract = {Background and objective
The incubation period of COVID-19 helps to determine the optimal duration of the quarantine and inform predictive models of incidence curves. Several emerging studies have produced varying results; this systematic review aims to provide a more accurate estimate of the incubation period of COVID-19.
Methods
For this systematic review, a literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Scopus/EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering all observational and experimental studies reporting the incubation period and published from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2020.We estimated the mean and 95th percentile of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables.
Results
We included seven studies (n=792) in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity (I2 83.0%, p<0.001) was significantly decreased when we included the study quality and the statistical model used as moderator variables (I2 15%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.6 (95% CI: 5.2–6.0) to 6.7 days (95% CI: 6.0–7.4) according to the statistical model. The 95th percentile was 12.5 days when the mean age of patients was 60 years, increasing 1 day for every 10 years.
Conclusion
Based on the published data reporting the incubation period of COVID-19, the mean time between exposure and onset of clinical symptoms depended on the statistical model used, and the 95th percentile depended on the mean age of the patients. It is advisable to record sex and age when collecting data in order to analyze possible differential patterns.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivo
El período de incubación de la COVID-19 ayuda a determinar la duración óptima del período de cuarentena y a crear modelos predictivos de curvas de incidencia. Se han reportado resultados variables en recientes estudios y, por ello, el objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es proporcionar una estimación más precisa del período de incubación de la COVID-19.
Métodos
Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica en las bases de datos de Pubmed, Scopus/EMBASE y la Cochrane Library, incluyendo todos los estudios observacionales y experimentales que reportaban un período de incubación y que se habían publicado entre el 1 de enero y el 21 de marzo de 2020. Se estimó la media y el percentil 95 del período de incubación mediante metaanálisis, teniendo en cuenta la heterogeneidad entre los estudios y el análisis con variables moderadoras.
Resultados
Se incluyeron siete estudios (n=792) en el metaanálisis. La heterogeneidad (I2 83,0%, p<0,001) disminuyó significativamente cuando se tuvo en cuenta la calidad del estudio y el modelo estadístico utilizado como variables moderadoras (I2 15%). El período medio de incubación oscilaba entre 5,6 (IC 95%: 5,2 a 6,0) y 6,7 días (IC 95%: 6,0 a 7,4), según el modelo estadístico utilizado. El percentil 95 fue de 12,5 días cuando la edad media de los pacientes era de 60 años, aumentando un día por cada 10 años de edad.
Conclusión
Según los datos publicados sobre el período de incubación de la COVID-19, el tiempo medio entre la exposición y la aparición de los síntomas clínicos depende del modelo estadístico utilizado y el percentil 95, de la edad media de los pacientes. Se recomienda registrar el sexo y la edad en la recogida de los datos para poder analizar los posibles patrones diferenciales.}

ABSTRACT = {Three major outbreaks of the coronavirus, a zoonotic virus known to cause respiratory disease, have been reported since 2002, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the most recent 2019-nCoV, or more recently known as SARS-CoV-2. Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the na&iuml;ve human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat. To this end, current up-to-date information on the coronavirus evolution and SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission, detection techniques and current control and prevention strategies are summarized in this review.},
